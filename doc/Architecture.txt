Classes
-------

StrokeModel: contains the information for each stroke in the current frame
StrokeRecorder: records a single stroke
StrokePlayer: plays a collection of strokes in parallel

	StrokeRecorder:
		StrokeModel.add(x, y, paintState);
		StrokeModel.emit("addStroke", new Event(x, y, paintState) );

	StrokeModel.on("addStroke", function(event) { // event.data contains all the info
		var strokes = self.getStrokeCollection();
		StrokePlayer.play(strokes);
	});

Input: StrokeRecorder (UserCanvas: user interactions)
Output: StrokePlayer (TrailCanvas: for replaying the trail animation)


If while animating, there's more input (user drawing)
	-> queue the request until the animation is done and replay!

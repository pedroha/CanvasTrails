ROADMAP

-----------------------

Major features

* Multi-layer
* FullStroke (play/pause/rewind: Play Framework) -> Use some pausable/resumable recursive setTimeout()
* Persistence (localStorage)
* Inking (inking gestures)

Would like to cleanup: onclick -> click/touchstart (and no fastclick library included: lighter)

Need to test on mobile more often


-----------------------

TODAY (June 27)

* Save / Load -> Model (brush vector instructions) in localStorage


-----------------------

Issues with <canvas> in Firefox
 
 * Brush is red color -> resetModel() didn't work !?
 * Few other painting/coloring issues

New Palette (change palette?)

* [Stop] -> Not cancelling running "intervals" in the future



-----------------------

Major features

A) Support multiple Animation frames (maybe 4 to 8)
B) Brush Sizes (up to 4)
C) Support both brushes: Static (to paint background) and Animated
D) Support for iPad resolution (normal and retina, mini-ipad)


-----------------------
DONE

0) Proof of concept [done]

a) Fixed: remove a for-loop of 5 repaints (not needed)

1) Support for "state": which color was painted with.
	Each stroke needs to be repainted with "user" color

b) Adding a masking layer but still it doesn't work perfectly: user can still paint while drawing is still executing.

2) Transparent User Canvas: to control and draw "current" stroke
   Bug: when painting and "user drawing" happens at the same time.

   Done: re-architecture (v1)


2.5) Add support for touch events using:
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/DOM/Events/Touch_events

	* Test in ipad, iphone devices

Later, which one to use?
https://github.com/EightMedia/hammer.js
https://github.com/mudcube/Event.js

First touch: no drawing (should we add a DOT? Yeah)

EventEmitter: minor improvements

3) Color palette: brush colors

   Exercise on jquery selector and output to console for each match.

4) HTML page redesign (mobile friendly), ipad-friendly

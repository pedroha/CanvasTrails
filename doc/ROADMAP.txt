ROADMAP

-----------------------
DONE

0) Proof of concept [done]

a) Fixed: remove a for-loop of 5 repaints (not needed)

1) Support for "state": which color was painted with.
	Each stroke needs to be repainted with "user" color

b) Adding a masking layer but still it doesn't work perfectly: user can still paint while drawing is still executing.


-----------------------
TODO

2) Transparent User Canvas: to control and draw "current" stroke
   Bug: when painting and "user drawing" happens at the same time.

3) Color palette: brush colors

   Exercise on jquery selector and output to console for each match.

4) HTML page redesign (mobile friendly)

-----------------------
Major features

A) Support multiple Animation frames (maybe 4 to 8)
B) Brush Sizes (up to 4)
C) Support both brushes: Static (to paint background) and Animated
D) Support for iPad resolution (normal and retina, mini-ipad)

? Get a UX person (or designer?) to collaborate on the design of the app.
